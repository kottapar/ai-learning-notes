## Machine Learning
It is the science of developing algorithms and statistical models to correlate data. Computer systems use machine learning algorithms to process large quantities of historical data and identify data patterns.

## Deep Learning
Deep learning models use neural networks that work together to learn and process information. They comprise millions of software components that perform micromathematical operations on small data units to solve a larger problem. For example, they process individual pixels in an image to classify that image.

## Neural Networks
Artificial neural networks form the core of artificial intelligence technologies. They mirror the processing that happens in the human brain. Each artificial neuron, or node, uses mathematical calculations to process information and solve complex problems.
